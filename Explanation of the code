This Python code is plotting histograms of random numbers generated from different distributions using the Matplotlib library. It demonstrates the effects of using uniform and log-uniform distributions, as well as quantization levels, on the distribution of random numbers.

The first set of histograms shows random numbers generated from a uniform distribution with parameters low and high. The histogram is created with 100 bins.

The second to fourth sets of histograms show random numbers generated from a quantized uniform distribution (quniform) with different quantization levels (q=2, q=4, q=6). As the quantization level increases, the distribution becomes more discrete.

The fifth histogram set shows random numbers generated from a log-uniform distribution with parameters low and high.

The subsequent histograms demonstrate the effect of quantization levels (q=2, q=6, q=8) on the log-uniform distribution. As the quantization level increases, the distribution becomes more discrete.

These histograms visually represent the distribution of random numbers generated from different distributions and the impact of quantization levels on the distribution's granularity.
